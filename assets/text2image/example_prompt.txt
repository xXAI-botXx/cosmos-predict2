A well-worn broom sweeps across a dusty wooden floor, its bristles gathering crumbs and flecks of debris in swift, rhythmic strokes. Dust motes dance in the sunbeams filtering through the window, glowing momentarily before settling. The quiet swish of straw brushing wood is interrupted only by the occasional creak of old floorboards. With each pass, the floor grows cleaner, restoring a sense of quiet order to the humble room.
